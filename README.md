# Xiaomi Miot For HomeAssistant

English | [简体中文](https://github.com/al-one/hass-xiaomi-miot/blob/master/README_zh.md)

[MIoT-Spec](https://iot.mi.com/new/doc/design/spec/overall): The protocol specification for Xiaomi IoT devices, is a standard designed by the Xiaomi IoT platform to describe the function definition of hardware products according to the networking mode of hardware products, the characteristics of product functions, the characteristics of user usage scenarios and the user's requirements for hardware product use experience specification.

This component uses the **miot** protocol to automatically integrate Xiaomi devices into [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), and currently supports most Xiaomi IoT devices. And it supports HA Web UI, and you can easily integrate Xiaomi devices into HA without configuring yaml.

## Installing

> Download and copy `custom_components/xiaomi_miot` folder to `custom_components` folder in your HomeAssistant config folder

```shell
# Auto install via terminal shell
wget -q -O - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/al-one/hass-xiaomi-miot/install.sh | bash -
```

> Or you can install component with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz)


## Config

> [⚙️ Configuration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config) > Devices and Services > [🧩 Integrations](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations) > [➕ Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=xiaomi_miot) > 🔍 Search `Xiaomi Miot Auto`

Or click: [![Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=xiaomi_miot)

### Add devices using Mi Account:
Starting from the v0.4.4 version, the component has added support for selecting the connection device mode when integrated by account:
- **Automatic**: The component will regularly update [the devices that support miot-spec in LAN](https://github.com/al-one/hass-xiaomi-miot/blob/master/custom_components/xiaomi_miot/core/miot_local_devices.py), and automatically use the local connection for the supported devices (recommended)
- **Local**: All devices filtered by the integrated configuration will use local connection. If you check the devices that do not support miot in LAN, they will be unavailable
- **Cloud**: All devices filtered by the integrated configuration will use cloud connection. It is recommended that miio, BLE, ZigBee devices use this mode

### Add device using host/token:
Suitable for devices support miot-spec protocol in LAN

### Config Xiaomi Cloud:

> Config Xiaomi cloud for the devices **integrated by host/token**

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
xiaomi_miot:
  username: xiaomi_username
  password: xiaomi_password
  # server_country: cn # Location of xiaomi cloud: cn(default), de, i2, ru, sg, tw, us
  # http_timeout: 15   # Timeout (seconds) for requesting the xiaomi apis
```

> [⚙️ Configuration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config) > Devices and Services > [🧩 Integrations](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations) > Xiaomi Miot Auto > Options > ☑️ Enable miot cloud

### Translations

> Looking forward to your [contribution](https://github.com/al-one/hass-xiaomi-miot/edit/master/custom_components/xiaomi_miot/core/translation_languages.py).

  chunk_properties: 10 # Chunk miot properties on update state (LAN)

```

### Filter entity attributes

> Too many entity attributes will make your HA's database very large. If some entity attributes are useless to you, you can configure `exclude_state_attributes` to ignore them.

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
xiaomi_miot:
  exclude_state_attributes:
    - miot_type
    - stream_address
    - motion_video_latest
```

### YAML configuration reloading
Starting from the v0.4.16 version, the component has added support for configuration reloading (to avoid having to restart [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) instance after a YAML configuration change):
> [⚙️ Configuration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config) > Settings > [🖥️ Server Controls](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/server_controls) > YAML configuration reloading > 🔍 Look for `Xiaomi Miot Auto` (almost at the bottom of the list)
