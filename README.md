# Xiaomi Miot For HomeAssistant

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](https://github.com/al-one/hass-xiaomi-miot/blob/master/README_zh.md)

[MIoT-Spec](https://iot.mi.com/new/doc/design/spec/overall): The protocol specification for Xiaomi IoT devices, is a standard designed by the Xiaomi IoT platform to describe the function definition of hardware products according to the networking mode of hardware products, the characteristics of product functions, the characteristics of user usage scenarios and the user's requirements for hardware product use experience specification.

This component uses the **miot** protocol to automatically integrate Xiaomi devices into [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), and currently supports most Xiaomi IoT devices. And it supports HA Web UI, and you can easily integrate Xiaomi devices into HA without configuring yaml.


## Installing

> Download and copy `custom_components/xiaomi_miot` folder to `custom_components` folder in your HomeAssistant config folder

```shell
# Auto install via terminal shell
wget -q -O - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/al-one/hass-xiaomi-miot/install.sh | bash -
```

> Or you can install component with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz)


## Config

> [‚öôÔ∏è Configuration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config) > [üß© Integrations](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations) > [‚ûï Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=xiaomi_miot) > üîç Search `Xiaomi Miot Auto`

Or click: [![Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=xiaomi_miot)

### Add devices using Mi Account:
Starting from the v0.4.4 version, the component has added support for selecting the connection device mode when integrated by account:
- **Automatic**: The component will regularly update [the devices that support miot-spec in LAN](https://github.com/al-one/hass-xiaomi-miot/blob/master/custom_components/xiaomi_miot/core/miot_local_devices.py), and automatically use the local connection for the supported devices (recommended)
- **Local**: All devices filtered by the integrated configuration will use local connection. If you check the devices that do not support miot in LAN, they will be unavailable
- **Cloud**: All devices filtered by the integrated configuration will use cloud connection. It is recommended that miio, BLE, ZigBee devices use this mode

### Add device using host/token:
Suitable for devices support miot-spec protocol in LAN

### Config Xiaomi Cloud:

> Config Xiaomi cloud for the devices **integrated by host/token**

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
xiaomi_miot:
  username: xiaomi_username
  password: xiaomi_password
  # server_country: cn # location of xiaomi cloud: cn(default), de, i2, ru, sg, us
```

> [‚öôÔ∏è Configuration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config) > [üß© Integrations](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations) > Xiaomi Miot Auto > Options > ‚òëÔ∏è Enable miot cloud

### Config translation languages:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
xiaomi_miot:
  language: zh # Using the built-in dictionary, currently only `zh` is supported
  # https://github.com/al-one/hass-xiaomi-miot/blob/master/custom_components/xiaomi_miot/core/translation_languages.py
  translations:
    # Global dictionary
    idle: 'Á©∫Èó≤'
    busy: 'Â∑•‰Ωú‰∏≠'
    # Dictionary for specifying fan modes
    fan.mode:
      'straight wind': 'Áõ¥ÂêπÊ®°Âºè'
      'natural wind': 'Ëá™ÁÑ∂È£é'
    # Dictionary for specifying the drying modes of the washer
    washer.drying_level:
      moist: 'ÂæÆÊπø'
      extra: 'ÁâπÂπ≤'
```
